# Classification-of-Emotions-using-Natural-Language-Processing
##  Introduction:
Welcome to the “Emotions” dataset – a collection of English Twitter messages meticulously annotated with six fundamental emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. This dataset
serves as a valuable resource for understanding and analyzing the diverse spectrum of emotions
expressed in short-form text on social media.

## About the Dataset:
Each entry in this dataset consists of a text segment representing a Twitter message and a corresponding label indicating the predominant emotion conveyed. The emotions are classified into
six categories: sadness (0), joy (1), love (2), anger (3), fear (4), and surprise (5). Whether you’re
interested in sentiment analysis, emotion classification, or text mining, this dataset provides a rich
foundation for exploring the nuanced emotional landscape within the realm of social media. 

## Project Goal:
In this project, our focus is emotion classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
